#Why git-authors

This repo contains a simple Atom plugin to bridge this gap. It displays the list of authors along with their percentage contribution to the file by line.

# Install

Download via Atom Packages.

# Usage

Once installed, the `git-authors` shows up in the UI and can be invoked by typing `ctrl-opt-a` or `Packages->git-authors-toggle`. This displays a list of authors with their percentage contribution to the file
